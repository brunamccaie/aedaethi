Oh Reddit, today I probably did the most embarrassing thing of my career. I am alone on the support desk this evening as is usual with the holiday skeleton crews. I received a call from a user and I expected a normal call, but from my perspective, it was anything but. I asked for the users' name and employee ID, he provided his first name and told me he had just completed onboarding so he could not provide an employee ID. I automatically told him if he didn't have an employee ID I probably. Hebrew letters. To get an alef, you type \?+. On Windows, you have to install international support to get the left-to-right order correct. Here is a side by side battle between Emvoice One(TM) Lucy and VOCALOID5(TM) Amy. Please note that this is not a "straight out of the box" battle. I've spent many hours tweaking both to sound the best they can be. This included playing with their phonetics rather than just words, adding voice colour such as breathiness and mouth openness (for Vocaloid), adding harmonising background vocals.

So, I gave Stellaris a whirl (playing a non-up-to-date version, JIC; very jaded about development of Paradox titles that aren't CKII) and to my satisfaction I could roleplay/worldbuild pretty decently. I end up playing at a very slow pace, writing stuff down and renaming almost all that is renameable, but it's been fun so far. Now, having completed my first campaign, I've spent some effort getting all the info I'd jotted down organised nicely so that I have a good overview of what I've worldbuil.

Hello Everyone, My name is Zhiyuan Sun, a student attending the University of Alberta, Canada. In my spare time, I have an interest in exploring various written scripts and linguistics, and just yesterday, I came across a photo of the code hidden in the book where the Tamum Shud message originated via Youtube.

I think this morning may have been another milestone for my practice. Up until now, I had thought my understanding of how to mentally repeat the mantra was pretty solid. But out of nowhere, today I decided to investigate something. It's about the sound of the mantra. In NSR, the mantra is a single syllable with soft consonants and a soothing sound. Because it doesn't have many sharp edges like some of the TM ones, it tends to become more muffled and indistinct over time. Today I realized

When I read TheBigBrief a couple months ago, one thing that struck me was that it matched and accounted for a bunch of KZ's tweets. In the afterglow of her stunning defeat yesterday with Judge Sutkiewicz's denial of her 1200+ page motion, I looked over an old compilation of KZ tweets (https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/4fzc7p/zellner_tweets_building_a_case_xpost_from_main_sub/) to glean when exactly KZ landed on her RH theory and found these two: gtMarch 6, 2016 gtCell.
